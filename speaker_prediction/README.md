# Speaker prediction

This repository contains the source code for our speaker prediction model. The scene graph generation (SGG) component of our model is primarily based on the[Scene-Graph-Benchmark](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch). For a deeper understanding of the SGG component, please consult the detailed documentation available at [Scene Graph Benchmark in Pytorch](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch/blob/master/README.md).
